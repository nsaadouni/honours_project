Smart cards are used commercially and within industry for authentication, encryption, decryption, signing and verifying data. This paper aims to look into how the smart card interacts with an application at the lower level. PKCS\#11 (public key cryptography system?) is the standard that is implemented at the higher level and then broken down into command/response pairs sent as APDU traffic to and from the smart card. It is the APDU low-level protocol that will be analysed to see if any vulnerabilities are present with regard to the smart cards tested.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
Smart-cards are formally known as integrated circuit cards (ICC), and are universally thought to be secure, tamper-resistant devices. They store and process, cryptographic keys, authentication and user sensitive data. They are utilised to preform operations where confidentiality, data integrity and authentication are key to the security of a system.\\

\noindent Smart-cards offer what seems to be more secure methods for using cryptographic operations. (And should still provide the same level of security that would be offered to un-compromised systems, compared to those that are compromised by an attacker). This is partly due to the fact that the majority of modern smart-cards have their own on-board micro-controller, to allow all of these operations to take place on the card itself, with keys that are unknown to the outside world and stored securely on the device. Meaning the only actor that should be able to preform such operations would need to be in possession of the smart-card and the PIN/password. In many industries, for applications such as, banking/ payment systems, telecommunications, healthcare and public sector transport, 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Banking/ payment
%\item E-commerce
%\item Sim cards/ telecommunications
%\item Healthcare
%\item Public transport
%\end{itemize}
smart-cards are used due to the security they are believed to provide.\\


\noindent The most common API (application programming interface) that is used to communicate with smart-cards is the RSA defined PKCS\#11 (Public Key Cryptography Standard). Also known as 'Cryptoki' (cryptographic token interface, pronounced as 'crypto-key'). The standard defines a platform-independent API to smart-cards and hardware security modules (HSM). PKCS\#11 originated from RSA security, but has since been placed into the hands of OASIS PKCS\#11 Technical Committee to continue its work (since 2013). [reference wikipedia PKCS\#11].\\


% Note: decide on a figure to use here, 10 OR 15 years!
% This paragraph needs to be re-written!
\noindent In the previous 10-15 years, literature has shown a great deal of research into the examination of the PKCS\#11 API, and the security it provides. Yet little attention has been paid to that of the lower-level communication (command-response pairs), in which the higher level API is broken down into. It is this area that we wish to research within this paper. The reasoning is simple. If we cannot trust the security of the low-level commands that implement the high level API functions, then in turn we cannot trust the security of the high level API. This is analogous to C code being complied down to binary data to be operated on by the CPU. The addition of two integers cannot be considered correct in C, unless the corresponding binary instructions sent to the CPU are correct as well.

The research of the low-level communication will take two forms. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item An analysis of the raw communication between PC and Smart-card for all API function calls
\item 
\end{enumerate}


Before we move into the above analysis, supporting material must be introduced. This the rest of this paper will be organized as follows.

\chapter{Related Work / Literature Review}

This will be a brief chapter and will discuss all of the research I have conducted.\\
Mainly regarding PKCS\#11 API attacks due to the small amount of literature that is available for APDU level attacks
I shall also explain why some of the attacks are not able to be conducted on the particular card I am reviewing

\section{Manually Overriding Attributes}
This attack was found by previous literature. We simply tested to see if the same attack was feasiable on the smart card we analyse. 

To test this we created a DES3 key on the card that had the encrypt attribute set to False. We asked the card to encrypt the string '12345678'. The API returned an error stating that this function was not supported due to the attribute settings. We then override the API by manually sending the command overselves. This results in the encryption taking place on the card, when in-fact it should not.




%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{PKCS \#11 Functions - APDU analysis}

In this chapter we analyse the APDU traces of 9 functions from the PKCS \#11 API. C\_sign and C\_verify were not included in this analysis as from the traces of the previous work on this card it was clear that both of these functions operated in a similar manner to C\_encrypt and C\_decrypt. C\_create-Object was also omitted from this analysis, because of how similar it operates to generateKey and generateKeyPair. With the only difference is that the key values are provided by the user instead. The analysis will include a step by step guide of how the functions are broken down into command response pairs at the APDU level, and also suggest methods for attacking the card using this knowledge. 

All of the traces are provided in appendix B, and have been shortened to only include the parts which we deem to be the most important to the evaluation of how each function is broken down into APDU command response pairs. However, the full traces for each function are given within the project directory. In the analysis to come we will refer to appendix B, with the corresponding command response pair in brackets to allow ease of locating the steps we analyse.

\textit{To prevent repetition within each functions analysis and within the appendix, we list the dependencies (other functions that must be run before hand) at the start of each functions analysis, if it is required. And then omit the dependencies from the appendix and explanation of the given function.}

\section{Initialization}
The first process before anything can occur on the card is the initialization. This occurs as soon as a session is opened with the card. The process has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the laser PKI file and select the applet (B.1 - command 1)
\item Open the file and send to the API the cards serial number (B.1 - command 4,5)
\item Open a second file and send to the API another serial number (B.1 - command 8,9)
\end{enumerate}

None of these traces reveal sensitive information. But is required in order for the card to be able to operate and communicate with the API. The API is a generic library that works with many different hardware security modules created by the 'Athena smartcard solutions'. Hence this information is required by the library in order for it to operate correctly for the specific type of card.

\section{C\_login}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization]}\\


The login function has 5 main components. The API locates the file control parameters to check if the retry counter is greater than 0. In the APDU trace this is highlighted in bold and has a value of AA. From there the PIN file is selected, a challenge is asked for by the card and a response is calculated from the knowledge of the PIN and the challenge. Once this is completed the security status of the card is cleared. This is done because every security operation requires a new login by the API. While the user only logs in once, at the APDU layer this occurs many times. These steps are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open file control parameters for the PIN file (B.2 - command 10)
\item Open the PIN file (B.2 command 11)
\item Request challenge from card (B.2 - command 12)
\item Verify PIN (B.2 - command 13)
\item Clear security Status (B.2 - command 20)\\
\end{enumerate}

From evaluating multiple traces of the login, it is clear that the response calculated seems to have an element of randomness. From studying the traces alone, the method of calculating the response cannot be intuitively determined.

While no immediate sensitive information is revealed in this trace as the challenge-response algorithm used for verifying a users PIN hides its value, successfully reverse engineering the protocol will allow an attacker to calculate the users PIN given successful login trace.

Furthermore, if an attacker can find a method for changing the file control parameter, it might be possible to reset the retry counter at the APDU level to allow an unlimited number of attempts of logging in.
\section{C\_findObject}
\textit{[For this trace to show meaningful information we pre-loaded a triple des key onto the card. The label of the key was 'des3' with id '01']}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login]}\\


The findObjects function is split into 3 main components. First a cmapfile is accessed. This file stores the location of key attribute files. Following this attribute files are accessed; They store all the information regarding a specific keys attributes (listed in section 2.1.2). And finally the last file is opened. This file is zeroized, which dictates that no more attribute files for keys are present on the card. These steps are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select and open 'cmapfile' [List files command]. This stores all file locations for attributes of the keys (B.3 - command 32, 33, 34)
\item Based on those locations, find and open the attribute file for the des3 key (B.3 - command 36)
\item And also open the last attribute file to determine there are no more keys (B.3 - command 38, 39)\\
\end{enumerate}

Due to key and attribute files being stored separately, this function call reveals no sensitive information. Only the attributes are opened and listed at the APDU layer. These attributes can be printed at the API layer as well.

A possibility for an attack is present here. The ISO 7816 proprietary 'REALLOCATE BINARY' command can be used to modify a file. This will allow modification of attributes. As mentioned in the literature review, previous work on the same card was undertaken and modified the attributes of CKA\_sensitive \& CKA\_extractable from false to true. The change in this direction is forbidden by the API. However the ability for changing these at the APDU level was achieved. It still yielded no significant results, as keys and attribute are stored in separate files. And the keys could still not be loaded. Thus, we investigate this no further.

\section{C\_generateKey}
\textit{[For this trace we generate a triple DES key, key length of 24 bytes.]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login]}\\

The generateKey function has 9 main components. 2 different secure messaging sessions are used to generate 24 bytes (same as the key length) on the card and send it to the API, and create the key file. The attribute file is created without the use of secure messaging as it does not contain sensitive information. The steps are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open secure messaging (B.4 - commands 26, 27, 28)
\item Generate 24 random bytes and send them to the API via secure messaging (B.4 - command 29)
\item Close secure messaging (B.4 - command 30)
\item commands skipped include finding spare file for attributes and opening the file.
\item Update file with key attributes (B.4 - commands 40, 41)
\item Open secure messaging [again] (B.4 - commands 42, 43, 44)
\item Open key file directory via secure messaging (B.4 - command 45)
\item Create key file for triple DES key via secure messaging (B.4 - command 46)
\item Close secure messaging (B.4 - command 47)\\
\end{enumerate}

From this analysis of the communication trace it seems that the card is requested to generate the key value from a 'get challenge' request (within secure messaging). We assume that these same bytes are used to be stored in the key file of the triple DES key we ask it to generate. We cannot verify this at this time, as two different secure messaging sessions are used, and therefore have different session keys. This causes the encryption of the generated bytes and the storing of them in a file, to be different. Despite the possibility they are in fact identical. As stated in the literature review, previous hardware security modules created by 'Athena smartcard solutions' have in the past done this without the use of secure messaging. Thus that vulnerability seems to be patched in this version of the API and smartcard, by using secure messaging when generating these bytes and storing them in the key file. 

If this assumption turns out to be correct it posses as quite a significant vulnerability that could be exploited. If the protocol for secure messaging can be reversed engineered, then we can inject our own bytes when the the request challenge is sent to the card. Or simply we can use a man in the middle attack to generate two sets of session keys. One with the attacker and the API, and one with the attacker and the smartcard. The bytes can be sent to the card in the correct format, however the attacker will also be in knowledge of the key value. This should never be the case when the attribute CKA\_Sensitive is set to true.

A second vulnerability is also present here. Which is the ability to alter attributes on the fly as they are being updated within the file (step 5). Changing attribute values would allow for the key to be extracted as soon as it is created (this has been checked) however the user will be aware of it, as it is printed at the API layer. In addition they will also be able to see the modified attributes which they had not set. Thus we determine this to be a vulnerability, but not as serious as the previous one mentioned, as if it were utilised the user would most likely notice and therefore generate a new key to be used.



\section{C\_generateKeyPair}
\textit{[For this trace we generate an RSA-1024 public/private key pair]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login]}\\

We find 15 main components in this generation of the RSA public and private key pair. 7 components transfer data that are wrapped within an ASN.1 BER encoding [?]. These are to transfer public key information and what we believe to be file location parameters. The steps listed below give the ordering of the most important commands, and below that we give the decoding of the ASN.1 BER encoding of those 7 commands that we have found.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create public key attribute file (B.5 - command 54)
\item Add public key attributes to file [inc. public exponent] (B.5 - commands 56, 57)
\item Create private key attribute file (B.5 - command 59)
\item Add private key attributes to file (B.5 - commands 61, 62)
\item Create Private CTR RSA Key file (B.5 - command 64) [ref crypto section] [?]
\item Select temporary file (B.5 - command 65)
\item Generate RSA Key Pair (B.5 - command 66)
\item Select temporary file (B.5 - command 67)
\item Get RSA public key (B.5 - command 68)
\item Select parent folder of private key attribute file (B.5 - command 69)
\item Create new file, with public modulus and additional info (B.5 - command 70
\item Select temporary file (B.5 - command 71)
\item Get RSA public key (B.5 - command 72)
\item Select public attribute file (B.5 - command 73)
\item Add public modulus to attribute file (B.5 - command 74)
\item The rest of the communication we believe to be resetting the temporary file, and adding file location information to file control parameters of parent directories. (These commands are not included in the traces within the appendix)\\\\
\end{enumerate}

The following are the ASN.1 BER decodings of the commands that have these wrapping. An online tool was used in the aid of decoding these hexadecimal bytes [?]. We provide references to the above numbering of the commands, and the appexidx references as well.\\

RSA key pair generation is supported on the card. A dedicated processor is used for this, hence the need to change to temporary files to access the generated key and then store the public information. We see no sensitive information within the traces that are outputted in plain text. We thought that the additional information provided that is wrapped within the ASN.1 BER encoding, especially for \textbf{5}, might have exported the private key and the additional parameters required for CRT RSA keys [?]. To test this theory we deleted the generated key and generated another. The public modulus did change, however the remaining parameters did not. With a change in the public modulus, a change in the private exponent and therefore CRT parameters would also occur. Thus we concluded from that the private key is not exported out in plain text.

It seems these parameters that are listed above are used used to save the location of the RSA private key, and the public key for that matter. We have not been able to intuitively decode the proprietary encoding of file directories to locate the private key. As we will see later in the 'unwrap' function when we utilise the private key, this occurs within secure messaging and therefore cannot find the location of it from that either.

Thus without the knowledge of the proprietary encoding of file directories we do not see any vulnerabilities within the function as of yet. Studying multiple RSA key generation traces (without deleting the first keys) might show differences in these decodings which could lead to finding the location of the private key.


\section{C\_destroyObject}
\textit{[For this trace we delete/destroy a triple DES key and its attribute file]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login, FindObjects]}\\

Once the key and attribute files have been located and the user is authenticated with the card, there are 6 main components to the destruction of the object. These are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select counter file for key attributes (B.6 - command 49)
\item Update counter (B.6 - command 50)
\item Select key file (B.6 - command 53)
\item Delete key file (B.6 - command 54)
\item Select key attribute file (B.6 - command 55)
\item Delete key attribute file (B.6 - command 56)
\end{enumerate}

We believe a counter file keeps track of how many keys have been created and deleted in a certain path within the cards on board memory. We are unsure on its specific use as we have only seen it being updating upon deletion of an object, and the new counter value being appended to the new keys attributes (the one created after deleting an object). The original and updated counter value can be seen at B.6 - command 37 and 50 respectively.

Once this has been done the key attribute file and the key file are selected and deleted using the inter-industry command 'DELETE FILE'. This is the first time we have seen the location of a key file been accessed without secure messaging. Thus we thought this might present a vulnerability which would allow us to open and read key values at the APDU level. 

Hence we attempted to use the 'SELECT FILE' command and then 'READ BINARY' command to try and read the files data. This resulted in an error message = '69 81', meaning the command is incompatible with the file structure. With this in mind we decided to try the other command which is 'OPEN FILE CONTROL PARAMETERS' which did successfully work. The output was wrapped in an ASN.1 BER encoding, thus we decoded it which gave the following result:

Application 2(6 elem)\\
$[07]$ (1 byte) 08\\
$[03]$ (2 byte) 00 C1\\
$[00]$ (2 byte) 00 18\\
$[10]$ (1 byte) 04\\
$[06]$ (14 byte) 00 00 00 FF 00 FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\\
$[05]$ (4 byte) 01 0C 10 00\\

This seemed quite similar to what we noticed with the RSA private key analysis in the previous section. There is not present a 16 byte key that could be used for triple DES. Rather it seems that these are more pointers to more files that could hold the keys value. All security polices [?] that we have read for 'Athena smart-card solutions' suggest that keys are held in a non-readable memory to outside actors, and only when required are encrypted internally (by the cards OS) and stored in the EEPROM for them to be used for the security operation required of them. 

Thus we did not find any security vulnerabilities from this function.

\section{C\_encrypt}
\textit{[For this function we use a triple DES key to encrypt a string 'TestString123456'] using ECB mode]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login, FindObjects]}\\

The commands given for this trace are actually repeated and therefore occur twice for one encrpytion of a given string. This is due to PKCS \#11 library being programmed in C by the card manufactures. The resulting length of the encryption is thought to be of an undetermined size. (For block ciphers and even RSA this can be pre-calculated given the input length) However the implementation runs the encryption twice, the first run is to calculate the resulting length of the encryption, and the second run will save the result in a buffer that has been pre-allocated the correct number of bytes in a char array.

This function only has two main components to it, these are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select key file (B.7 - command 52)
\item Encrypt data (B.7 - command 53)\\
\end{enumerate}

The key file is selected and then the encryption APDU command is called with the string in the data field. As stated in destroyObject function analysis, despite the key file location being revealed here. It is not a file that can be opened nor reveals the value of the key. Instead is a pointer to other locations in memory that hold the key value. We assume that only the operating system has access to these locations but are unable to verify this hypothesis.

Due to this we see no other vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

\section{C\_decrypt}
\textit{[For this trace we use the same triple DES key to decrypt the message we previously encrypted]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login, FindObjects]}\\

The decrypt function operates nearly an identical manner to the encrypt function, just simply changes one byte (P1 in the APDU command header) in command 65. The key is loaded and then the decrypt APDU command is sent, with the encrypted string placed in the data field. For the same reasons stated in the encrypt function, the APDU command is sent twice. We omit this repetition. The commands are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select key file (B.8 - command 64)
\item Decrypt data (B.8 - command 65)\\
\end{enumerate}

As the decrypt function operates so similarly to the encrypt function, we saw no vulnerabilities present here as well. However we did notice the implementation flaw that had been picked up within previous work. For some reason the first 8 bytes are removed from the encrypted data. This therefore only decrypts and returns the second 8 bytes. As this does not present a security vulnerability, and rather is an issue with the functionality of the decrypt function, we do not analyse it any further.

\section{C\_setAttribute}
\textit{[For this trace we modify the label of the triple DES key from 'des3' to 'changed']}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login, FindObjects]}\\

There were only 2 main components for this function, similarly to encrypt and decrypt. The first one selected the attribute file, and the following 2 commands update the whole file to include the new name of the label to the key. Command chaining [?] was used as the number of bytes within the attribute file exceeded the limit of 256. Command chaining is indicated by the use of '90' instead of '80' as the CLA byte. The commands are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select key attribute file (B.9 - command 51)
\item Modify attribute file with the changed in the label name (B.9 - commands 52,53)\\
\end{enumerate}

Here we notice that at the APDU level attributes can be changed as long as a user is logged in. (We have not tested doing this without being logged in, but might be possible) This is a vulnerability that was discovered in previous work. With the main focus on changing the attribute values of CKA\_sensitive and CKA\_extractable from false to true. The change in this direction is forbidden by the PKCS \#11 API, however this can be conducted at the APDU layer. As stated in the literature review, this had been carried out and due to the split between attribute files and key value files, there was no noticeable difference. Despite those attributes being set to True, the key value could still not be revealed.

Thus, despite the vulnerability being present it does not cause a major security issue, in the sense that the key value is still stored securely.


\section{C\_unwrap}
\textit{[For this trace we used an RSA public key to encrypt a tripe DES key value = 12345678. With its encryption saved, we created a template and used the RSA private key to unwrap the key value and template, to save the key on the card]}

\textit{Function dependencies $\rightarrow$ [Initialization, Login, FindObjects, Encrypt]}\\


There are 10 main components involved in the unwrapping of a key. 2 different secure messaging sessions are used (just like in the generateKey function). These first secure messaging session is used to unwrap the encrypted key into a temporary file. The second secure messaging session is used to save that key into a key file. This comes after the attribute file has been created in between these two. The order of the commands are listed below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open secure messaging (B.10 - command 92, 93, 94)
\item Select a file [the file location is encrypted and therefore unknown] (B.10 - command 95)
\item Unwrap key and attributes (B.10 - command 96)
\item Close secure messaging (B.10 - command 97)
\item Select key attribute file (B.10 - command 119)
\item Add key attributes to file (B.10 - command 120, 121)
\item Open secure messaging (B.10 - command 122, 123, 124)
\item Select the key file directory (B.10 - command 125)
\item Create key file (B.10 - command 126)
\item Close secure messaging (B.10 - command 127)\\
\end{enumerate}

In a scenario were we are not already in the knowledge of the key value, the secure messaging sessions are the main vulnerability we would wish to try and exploit here. While the key is not exported at the APDU layer in plain text. Successfully reverse engineering the secure messaging protocol, would allow an attacker to exploit it, inject his own session keys and decrypt the key value. This was mentioned in the generateKey function analysis.


Furthermore an attacker could also modify the attributes on the fly. But as discussed within the generatKey function analysis, this attack would make the user aware of the fact that the key has been exported and that attributes have been changed. And thus is deemed not to be as bad as a vulnerability compared to one that would expose the key in plain text at the APDU layer without the users knowledge.


\section{C\_wrap}
The Tookan attack was mentioned within the literature review. It is an attack at the API level whereby one key can be given wrapping and decryption functionalities within its attributes. This allowed for any key (no matter the attributes) to be wrapped, exported out of the card, and then decrypted by the same key, and have its key value in plain text. This vulnerability bypassed all controls that the attributes of a key should provide. Due to this vulnerability discovery, we assume that 'Athena smartcard solutions' decided to remove the ability to wrap keys completely. This assumption came from that fact that requesting any key to wrap another key at the API level caused an error: \textit{CKR\_Function\_Not\_Supported}.

From analysing table 2.1 (section 2.24), we noticed a correlation between the P1 and P2 parameters for the APDU commands for encryption, decryption and unwrapping. These values are the following:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|}
\hline
P1 & P2 & Command\\
\hline
82 & 05 & encrypt\\
80 & 05 & decrypt\\
80 & 0A & unwrap\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The CLA and and INS bytes are identical for all of the above commands. 

Using the fact that for encrypt and decrypt P2 remains the same and only P1 alters from '80' to '82', then we inferred that is the wrap command was still supported at the APDU layer then the command would have values for P1 = \textbf{82} and P2 = \textbf{0A}. Therefore an example full command would be:\\
\textbf{00 2a 82 0a L Data 00}. Were L is the length of the data, and the data is the key to be wrapped. 

We ran a simple test to see if this command operates on the card:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wrap key (string '12345678') (B.11 - command 1)\\
\end{enumerate}


The result of the test was an APDU level error. '6A 80', meaning the parameters within the data field are incorrect. Suggesting that the command does exist and most likely corresponds to the wrap function.

The data field of unwrap is encrypted, as it is used within secure messaging. However if this was reversed engineered and we could understand the data field of the unwrap command, there is a high probability that we would be able to create the correct data field for the wrap command. This would allow us to bypass all attribute controls of keys at the API level, and implement the Tookan attack at the APDU level. Which in turn would all all keys on the card to be exported out of the card in plain text, which would be a serious violation of the PKCS \#11 standard.

\chapter{Attempts To Attack At the APDU Level}

In this chapter we explain the motivations, implementation and results of the attacks we attempt as the APDU level. For clarity purposes we first give a brief overview of the API's function analysis at the APDU layer that we conducted within chapter 6. This analysis in combination with previous work completed on the same smart-card and for that matter other smart-cards as well, drove the motivations behind the attacks we selected to conduct.

\section{Motivations}
\subsection{Vulnerabilities not investigated}
The \textit{initialization} function did not present any vulnerabilities that would be able to be exploited and was just needed in order for the API to correctly operate.

We did mention in the \textit{Login} function analysis it might be possible to either use 'REALLOCATE BINARY' or 'DELETE FILE' and 'CREATE FILE' in order to modify the parent directories file control parameters for the PIN file that is stored on the card. The aim of this would be to change the retry counter before it reached 0, which would cause the card to be in a blocked state. If this is possible then an unlimited number of attempts at guessing the users PIN would be possible. We decided to not focus on this attack as it would not be particularly useful without the knowledge of the challenge-response algorithm that is used to verify the users PIN.

\textit{FindObject} function did present the possibility to locate the object and at the APDU level modify any attribute. The two that have the most significance would be CKA\_extractable and CKA\_sensitive. This had been completed within previous work [?] and revealed no significant vulnerability. This was due to the fact that once the attributes had been set as part of the key generation process, the attribute file and key key file are separated and thus prevent the key from being exposed in plain text. Since this attack had already been investigated we did not see it fit to investigate it any further.

\textit{GenerateKey} and \textit{GenerateKeyPair} functions both provided a vulnerability whereby attributes could be modified on the fly as the key was being generated. This did leave the possibility of the key value being exposed as the key had not been generated yet. And effectively the card would be told to generate the key with the attributes the attacker sets. This vulnerability would always have to be exploited upon key generation and would be visible at the API level and therefore the user of the smart-card. Therefore while it is a viable attack to investigate, we decided to look into methods that would allow all keys to be exported in plain text regardless of whether or not the key was already generated and saved on the card.

\textit{Encrypt, Decrypt, GenerateKeyPair (private key)} and \textit{DestroyObject} functions all exported in plain text the directory of the key file. As we discussed in chapter 6 we thought that this might have provided the ability to open the file and read the key value in plain text. This hypothesises turned out to be incorrect, and instead seemed like the pointers to the cards memory were wrapped in an ASN.1 BER encoding. Decoding them did not give more insight, as a proprietary file directory organization was used. We also discussed that it is plausible that the keys are stored within memory that is only accessible by the smart-cards operating system. Thus, decided to not investigate this possible vulnerability due to the large possibility of not being able to open the files even if the correct directories were located.

\textit{Unwrap} function did not provide any major vulnerabilities either. Instead we would like to know exactly how the data field is built, but this cannot be inferred from traces as the command is only ever used within secure messaging. Therefore the data field is encrypted. The reason for wanting to understand how the command works is explained in the next section.

\subsection{Vulnerabilities to investigate}

From studying the traces for the \textbf{\textit{login}} function it was apparent that a challenge-response algorithm has been implemented in an attempt to provide a secure method for transporting the PIN for verifaction by the smart-card without ever revealing its value in plain text (which would be against the PKCS \#11 standard). This is an improvement implementations from other card manufactures whereby they did just send the PIN in plain text over the APDU layer for the smart-card to verify it, leaving an attacker the ability to simply sniff the communication and extract the users PIN number. However the challenge-response algorithm that 'Athena smartcard solutions' have implemented on this card still leaves the potential for an attacker to reverse engineer the protocol, and then brute force the PIN until the same response is calculated to be sent to the card. Doing this would give the attacker the knowledge of the users PIN and also remove the first dependency on the use of the API by an attacker. This is therefore the first attack that we investigate.

Furthermore the use of secure messaging to encrypt and also provide an integrity check (that the commands have not been altered in transit) in the form a a message authentication code being appended to the command was found within two functions. These are \textbf{\textit{GenerateKey}} and \textbf{\textit{unwrap}}. Successfully reverse engineering the secure messaging protocol would allow for two objectives to be complete. Firstly within the generateKey function an attacker would be able to implement a man in the middle attack to either alter the key being generated with a value known to the attacker, or simply decrypt the key to find out its value. This would be possible regardless of the attributes set for the key, and therefore would violate the standard to a large extent if the attributes for CKA\_sensitive and CKA\_extractable were set to true and false respectively. As an attacker would be able to be in the knowledge of the block cipher keys generated when the card should be the only system with said knowledge.

Secondly is the understanding behind how the \textbf{\textit{Unwrap}} APDU command operates. As stated in section 6.11, despite the API removing the ability to use the \textbf{\textit{Wrap}} functionality (most likely due the Tookan attack discovery [?]), with a high probability the APDU command still exists as we managed to send what we believe to be the correct command and received back an error stating the data field parameters were incorrect. Therefore reverse engineering the secure messaging protocol would allow us to fully understand the \textbf{\textit{Unwrap}} command data field, and possibly then be able to generate the correct command for wrapping a key. If this is possible, then the Tookan attack could be implemented at the APDU level, bypassing all attribute controls and exporting any/ all keys that are stored within the card. This would be considered a serious vulnerability.

All the vulnerabilities stated within this section are also all to be implemented at the APDU layer and would not provide the user the knowledge the attack is in process. This is the main reasoning behind selecting these vulnerabilities to investigate, and the fact they are far more serious compared to the others mentioned, in terms of violations of the PKCS \#11 API.



\section{Reverse Engineering PIN Authentication Protocol}
The first attack we investigate is the reverse engineering of the PIN authentication protocol. If this is successful an attacker will be able to brute force and/ or use a dictionary attack to calculate the users PIN. It shall also remove one dependency on the use of the API. As of right now the API is required to login into the smartcard as we are unaware of how the challenge-response algorithm is implemented. Figure 7.1 shows the procedure for logging into the smartcard at the APDU level.

% IMAGE: challenge-response pin authentication

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]
  {images/section_7/7.2/authencation_method.png}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Challenge Response Procedures}
\end{figure}

The API requests (via a 'GET CHALLENGE' command) the smartcard to generate and send back 8 random bytes. The API then calculates a 16 byte response based upon the knowledge of the challenge (8 random bytes) and the users PIN. The 16 byte response is sent to the smartcard (via a 'VERIFY' command), which will return one of two possible outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item '90 00' $\rightarrow$ Verification of users PIN succeeded
\item '63 CX' $\rightarrow$ Verification of users PIN failed. (X = number of attempts left before the card is blocked)\\
\end{enumerate}

The following sections give explanations of the searches that we conducted to try and reverse-engineer the protocol showed above. To give a full understanding of how challenging this part of the project was, we will explain the combinations of possibilities we checked, and the reasoning behind each of them. These will be split up into different 'searches', and increment in terms of new findings and understanding of how the protocol may be implemented.

To aid these explanations, we introduce here 3 key sub-functionalities that most of the conducted searches use. Table 7.1 lists all the hash functions (see section 3.1) that were used, and provides the output length in bits \& bytes. Those hash functions were all supported by openSSL and the smartcard. Table 7.2 provides the names of the bitwise logical operations that were used to 'join' two bytes together. And table 7.3 provides the description of truncation methods used to reduce the output size of a search down to 16 bytes to match the response provided by the API. \\

From here on, in the explanation of the searches I will just refer to \textbf{\textit{hash}}, \textbf{\textit{join}} \& \textbf{\textit{truncate}} which will suggest that all of the elements in the tables have been iterated over and preformed on. For example \textbf{\textit{truncate(hash('example'))}}, means the string, 'example', is to be hashed with all the functions in table 7.1, and then truncated to 16 bytes using all the methods listed in table 7.3.\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Truncation Methods}
\end{table}

Before any searches could be conducted, the first task was to extract the values of the 8 byte challenge (denoted X), and the 16 byte response (denoted Y), from a communication trace of C\_login. Table 7.4 provides the values for the PIN, X and Y in hexadecimal format.\\

 
% TABLE: PIN, X, Y
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
Data & ASCII & HEX\\
\hline
PIN & '0000000000000000' & 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30\\

\hline
X & N/A & 68 F1 E4 92 85 36 39 A3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{}
\end{table}

In the very first original experiments, we made assumptions that the PIN number was only numerical characters, only had 4-8 digits and if the PIN was less than 8 characters, it was padded using a special character to form 8 bytes. Some of these assumptions turned out to be false, and thus the elementary experiments were all flawed from the beginning. I have not included a description of those experiments in the following sections, as many of them were in fact very similar to those explained below, just with different assumptions of the PIN. They also used a PIN for the card that was '12345', and hence there was an exponential explosion in the number of experiments for a particular search, due to needing to test for different padding schemes and characters. Hence why in these following experiments the PIN had been set to '0000000000000000' (16 zeros, no need for padding). We found that 16 characters was the upper limit to what a user can set the PIN to be by changing the PIN and incrementing its length until the API returned an error.


\subsection{Authentication Protocol Search 1.0 (Password Storage)}
Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item PIN consists of alpha - numeric characters
\item PIN is a maximum of 16 bytes
\item PIN is encoded in ASCII characters
\item For a given challenge and PIN there is only one corresponding response that API will calculate\\
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------
\textbf{\underline{Search 1 - Hash functions}}\\
In this initial stages we thought that there is a large possibility that the 16 byte response was generated by hashing a combination of the PIN and the 8 byte challenge. This was partly due to common practices used in industry whereby users passwords are often hashed, and in most cases salted (see section 3.1), before storing them in databases. This practice is more secure than storing plain text passwords, as if an attacker were to gain access to the back end databases storing said passwords, the password itself would not be available to see. For authenticating a user on a website the password is just hashed (and salted, if a salt is used), and then compared against to the stored value. 

The fact that from multiple traces the 16 byte response seemed to be uniformly random, it supported this hypothesis. Thus the first search that we completed focused on the fact that a hash function was used to produce the 16 byte response. Below we have listed the methods tested in experiments to generate 16 bytes, given X and the PIN.

\textit{[We denote $\|$ as the concatenation function. Thus for two strings 'string1 ' $\|$ 'string2' = 'string1 string2']}\\

\textbf{\underline{Methods tested that produced a 16 byte output using X and the PIN}}
\begin{itemize}
\item join(truncate(hash(X)), pin))
\item truncate(hash(join(pin, X $\|$ X)))
\item truncate(hash(pin$\|$X))
\item truncate(hash(X$\|$pin))
\item truncate(hash(pin+X))
\item truncate(hash(join(pin, square(X))))
\end{itemize}

\textit{[The methods should be read from the most inner brackets, outward. Therefore this means that the first method dictates that X is first hashed using one of the hash functions listed in the table 7.1. The output of that is then truncated to 16 bytes using one of the functions from table 7.3. All iterations of the functions in the tables were tested.]}

The following experiment did not result in finding a match to the response generated by the API. Thus we moved onto search 2.\\


%--------------------------------------
\textbf{\underline{Search 2 - PBKDF2}}\\
Following the failure of search 1, but still assuming there is a large possibility of a hash function being used, due to the common practices mentioned in search 1, and the characteristics known so far of the 16 bytes calculated by the API we decided to look at the password-based key derivation function.  

PBKDF2 was created as part of PKCS \#5 by RSA laboratories [?] and is starting to be used for more secure password storage as well as for key derivation. Essentially PBKDF2 takes as input, a password (the PIN), a salt (the 8 byte challenge X), a hash function, and the number of iterative rounds. If the number of iterative round is set to 10, then the salted password would be hashed once, and the output of that would be the input for the next round of hashing. This would be completed 10 times. Literature [?] has shown that the standard for the number of iterative rounds used to be 10,000, back in 2008 (check this date). Now it is suggested to use as many rounds as is computationally feasible by the device. Due to the processing power of a smart-card I assumed that this would not exceed 100,000 rounds, in the case that PBKDF2 was used.

Hence this search generated experiments that ran through 1 $\rightarrow$ 100,000 rounds of PBKDF2. As the default of PBKDF2 is to truncate the output by taking the first \textit{i} number of bytes, therefore the only truncation method used was 'first\_16' (table 7.3).\\

\underline{\textbf{Methods tested that produced a 16 byte output using X and the PIN}}
\begin{itemize}
\item PBKDF2( hash\_function, PIN, X, number\_of\_rounds)
\end{itemize}

This generated 100,000 experiments per hash function. With 5 hash functions, this resulted in half a million tests being run. Due to the sheer computational power required for this search I decided to parallelize the search based on the hash function, and run them on separate cores of a server. Even by improving the efficiency of this search, it still took 2 weeks to conduct.

Again this unfortunately did not result in a match between the 16 byte responses calculated and Y (the API's response). Hence we move onto search 3.

\subsection{Authentication Protocol Search 2.0 (One Time Passwords)}

%--------------------------------------
% source is OCRA!!!
\textbf{\underline{Search 3 - OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm}}\\
With no luck of deducing the challenge-response algorithm, we decided to look into more complex standards that exist and used in different parts of the computing industry for challenge response protocols, rather than password storage techniques. The international engineering task force (IETF) released a paper in 2011 [?]. Section 7.1 of the paper gives a one-way challenge response algorithm which fitted the characteristics of the authentication that takes between the API and the smart-card. We have extracted out the protocol and provided it below:

In the previous section of the paper they explain that OCRA in the instance of this protcol stands for a generic variable to state which form of HOTP is to be used. HOTP (see section 3.5.1 of this paper) can take on different formula's due to using different hash functions. The generic formula is:\\
$$HOTP(K,C) = Truncate(HMAC(K,C)) \quad \&\& \quad 0x7FFFFFFF$$

where K and C stands for the password (secret key) and is a counter (the challenge) respectively.

We ran experiments using the 5 hash functions listed in table 7.1, and even inter-changed K and C to have each others values instead. This did not result in finding a matching response to the one the API had calculated.\\

\textbf{\underline{Search 4 - TOTP}}\\
With the above in mind, I also wanted to rule out the possible use of \textit{time based one time passwords} (see section 3.5.2). TOTP algorithms are rarely used within smartcards due to the complexity of syncing the clocks between the computer and the smart-cards processors, and then also accounting for any lag. Despite the low probability of it being used it was worth checking.

This was completed by halting communication between the smart-card and API using the man-in-the-middle tool (see section 4.2). I did this for upto 2 hours. We were looking for a failed verification, despite having the correct PIN. The failure should have been caused by the delay in the response if TOTP was used. This was not found and therefore ruled out that possibility.

\subsection{Authentication Protocol Search 3.0 (Triple DES Encryption)}

With none of the above searches concluding any useful results, and instead just ruling out them as possibilities we moved onto checking an assumption that we were not 100\% sure was accurate. This would have been done earlier, however it had taken a while to get the code for the man in the middle attack to be operational, and was required for this. The assumption in question was, that \textit{for a given challenge and PIN, the API will calculate only 1 corresponding response}. 

To verify this assumption we used the man in the middle tool to inject our own challenge (that the card normally sends) and set it to '00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00'. Completing this multiple times, we noticed that this assumption was in-fact wrong. Over multiple attempts we saw different responses being calculated by the API, despite the PIN and the challenge being the same. However we also noticed that logins with quick successions of one an other had the same value for the response when the same PIN and challenge were present, and in some cases only the last 8 bytes changed with the first 8 bytes remaining the same.

Due to these observations we decided to run multiple experiments to find characteristics of the 16 bytes response \textit{(which we now believe to be split into two 8 byte parts)}. We did this by logging into the card twice each time, and altering the three parameters \textit{(one at a time)} that we determined to cause the response to alter. The parameters we alter are \textbf{\textit{time, PIN}} and the \textbf{\textit{challenge}}. The results of the experiments are tabulated below:

\textit{[To make the explanation of this clearer we have placed the actual traces of these experiments within \textbf{appendix A}. And use variable names for the two 8 byte sections of the 16 byte response. These are denoted below as A and B]}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Multiple logins with different parameters}
\end{table}

Table 7.5 shows that changing the second the separate logins occur within, or changing the PIN causes the whole 16 bytes to alter. If both login attempts are within the same second, and the same PIN and challenge are given to the API then the exact same 16 byte response is calculated. However the most interesting characteristic discovered within these experiments is when the logins occur within the same second, with the same PIN but different challenge. This causes the first 8 bytes to remain the same, but the second 8 bytes to differ, within the 16 byte response. 

This is the characteristic that provides the evidence to support our theory that the 16 byte response is in-fact split into to 8 byte sections. This also shows that that the second 8 bytes is a function that utilises the challenge. As a different challenge causes it to change. Based on these facts we assume the following:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first 8 bytes is a random number $N_A$ = Nonce API, which is seeded with time (in seconds)
\item The second 8 bytes is a another number that verifies the knowledge of both the challenge and $N_A$. We denote this as $V_{AC}$
\item A block cipher (see section 3.3) is used to encrypt both of these numbers, to send over to the card for PIN verification
\item A function of the PIN, is the password to the block cipher
\item The PIN is still of maximum length 16 bytes
\item The PIN is still in ASCII format
\end{enumerate}

To sum up we assume at this stage the challenge-response algorithm uses a function of the PIN to be the password to a block cipher which encrypts a message in this format:\\
$$ block\_cipher\_encrypt(N_A || V_{AC})$$

The block ciphers that are supported by the card are listed below:
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Block Cipher & Key Size & Block Size\\
\hline
AES & 16 & 16\\
DES & 8 & 8\\
\textbf{Triple DES  \textit{(key option 2)}} & \textbf{16} & \textbf{8}\\
Triple DES  \textit{(key option 3)} & 24 & 8\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The use of the block cipher AES is ruled out as a possibility as if it was used the characteristic that we found would not be present. A change to the challenge, within the same second and given the same PIN would result in a different encryption of both 8 bytes because AES would operate over the entire 16 byte block. This leaves only DES and triple DES as a viable option. 

We eliminated the possibility of standard DES being used due to its key size. It would not make logical sense to use a function of the password and then truncate it down to 8 bytes from 16 bytes. This would drop the security of the login from 256 bits to 128 bits for no reason, as other options are available.

This therefore only left us with triple DES key options 2 and 3. With the fact in mind that the PIN for the user is of maximum length 16 bytes we decided to focus on key option 2 which has 16 byte password. There is a possibility that the password is hashed for example and 24 bytes are used with key option 3, but we decided to first test key option 2 before moving onto 3 in the case that 2 fails.

Due to the assumption that the second 8 bytes is a verification (possible join, or hashing) of both the cards challenge and $N_A$, then we could not simply just decrypt the 16 byte response and analyse it. As both number could be completely unknown to us, therefore we would have no method of verifying we have the correct protocol. To mitigate this we decided to get 2 different responses, within the same second and with the same challenge, but using different PIN's. If the password to the block cipher is in-fact a function of the PIN, then the correct decryption of both responses with different passwords should evaluate to the same 16 bytes. This is how we will verify if we have found the correct protocol.\\

\textbf{\underline{Search 5 - Triple DES \textit{(Key option 2)}-ECB}}\\
Table 7.6 shows the data for two logins that occurred within the same second, with the same challenge (that we injected), but using two different PINs. We then generate 6 different possible passwords for the encryption using the PIN. The first is simply the PIN in ascii format at 16 bytes (all zeros). The following 5 are the PIN hashed with the hash functions in table 7.1, and truncated only using the first\_16 truncation method within table 7.3. Using the generated passwords we decrypt the 16 byte responses using triple DES key option 2, and list the results in table 7.7.

\caption{\textit{Decryption Results}}
\end{table}

The results are interesting. While we did not find an exact match of the entire responses when decrypting both of them, we did find a match for the first 8 bytes. This suggests we have found the correct formatting of the PIN, but the wrong decryption methodology. A change in the second 8 bytes suggest cipher block chaining is used. Hence we move onto search 6.\\

\textbf{\underline{Search 6 - Triple DES \textit{(Key option 2)}-CBC}}\\
Triple DES block cipher using cipher block chaining (CBC) requires an initialization vector (IV) to be used (see section 3.3). The IV is 8 bytes in length. Common practice is to send this in plain text along with the encryption of a message. However it is quite clear that this does not occur. The only other possibility is that the card and the API already have agreed upon a value to use, and always use this same value. The most common practice is too use an IV = 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00. Despite it being a bad an insecure practice, this still does occur. Hence, in the following experiment we only test the pin method for SHA1(PIN$_{1,2}$) and decrypt the corresponding responses using triple DES-CBC with an IV of zeros.


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
\hline
Pin Method & Response & Decryption using Triple DES-ECB\\
\hline
SHA1(PIN) & 1 & FE5DBEA8ECAB2F86 0000000000000001\\
SHA1(PIN) & 2 & FE5DBEA8ECAB2F86 0000000000000001\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Decryption Results}
\end{table}

Table 7.8 lists shows the results of both decryption's. The result is better than what we had originally assumed. The second 8 bytes, which we thought would have been a verification number (join or hash) (showing knowledge of both nonces), is in fact just the cards challenge. This almost completes our attack. As now we can produce a 16 byte response, given the cards challenge, the PIN and a nonce to place at the start of the message to encrypt.

The issue is we are not sure if we can just place any 8 byte nonce at the start of message to be encrypted. As the API might be expecting some sort of counter, and might refuse invalid values. Hence we conduct the final stage of this attack to test if we can place any value there, and hence will have fully reversed engineered the PIN authentication protocol.

To sum up so far this is the protocol we believe to be in place:
\begin{itemize}
\item Request and get an 8 byte challenge from the card, denoted \textbf{N$_c$}
\item Password for encryption = Truncate\_First\_16( SHA1 ( PIN ) ) )
\item Block cipher used = Triple-DES-CBC
\item Initialization Vector = 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
\item Calculate the response as the following:
$$ Encrypt(N_a || N_c) $$
\item were \textbf{N$_a$} is a nonce determined by the API.
\end{itemize}

We set N$_a$ to equal 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00, calculate what we believe to be a valid response and send it the the API. This experiment is shown within appendix A.2. The result of it is an APDU response of '90 00', successful login!

Thus concluding this attack.


\section{Reverse Engineering Secure Messaging}

The second attack we investigate is the reverse engineering of the secure messaging protocol used by the card. As stated within section 2.2, and within public 'Athena smart-card solutions' security policies [?] for several different cards the vendor produces, the secure messaging initialization is used to derive 2 session keys. S$_{Enc}$, S$_{Mac}$ are used to encrypt and compute a message authentication code (MAC) of the messages within a secure messaging session respectively. This provides confidentiality and data integrity of the messages. The decision for how to derive these keys is left entirely upto the card vendor. Which makes this particularly difficult as there are several methods that could be used.

The secure messaging sessions have seen to be used within the \textbf{\textit{GenerateKey}} and \textbf{\textit{Unwrap}} in the analysis conducted within chapter 6. And also seen to be used within \textbf{\textit{CreateObject}} seen in the analysis conducted by an MSC student (place name here) last year [?]. In every case it is used to provide confidentiality of the CKA\_value of block cipher keys. Successfully reverse engineering the secure messaging protocol would allow an attacker to use a man in the middle attack to derive two sets of session keys (one with the API and one with the card) which would allow the correct keys to be sent to the card, but also allow the attacker to decrypt them and find out the value is said keys. This would violate the PKCS \#11 standard if the keys were set to be sensitive and un-extractable. In addition, it would also be an attack whereby the user would be completely unaware it had taken place. This is considerably worse than previously analysed attacks were there is a large possibility of the user finding out, and therefore changing the keys before an attacker is able to utilise them for malicious purposes.

We also hope to be able to learn how the \textbf{\textit{unwrap}} command data field is built and then build the correct command for \textbf{\textit{wrap}} at the APDU level. This should be able to be completed by decrypting the data field of the unwarp command when used via the API. With this knowledge it should be possible to implement the Tookan attack [?] at the APDU level, and will therefore allow the exporting of all keys including RSA private keys which are generated on the card and thought to be securely stored.

To begin with we use the API to call the function \textbf{\textit{GenerateKey}}, as we know that secure messaging is utilised within this function. This gives us an overview of how the secure messaging protocol works. Below is a diagram that visually shows what exactly occurs at the APDU level. (The actual APDU commands are stored within appendix A.3.1)

% IMAGE: Secure Messaging Protocol

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]
  {images/section_7/7.3/secure_messasing.png}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Secure Messaging Initialization}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure 7.2 the API first requests the public key of the card. In total (split between two messages due to the size exceeding 256 bytes) the card sends back \textit{265} bytes worth of data, which is its public key. The API then proceeds to send back to the card 131 bytes worth of data \textit{(from multiple traces we have found that these 131 bytes of data change every single time, a new secure messaging session is opened)}. Finally the card sends 32 bytes of data, which concludes the initialization of secure messaging. Now the card and the API are both aware of two sets of block cipher keys S$_{Enc}$ and S$_{Mac}$ which are used to encrypt all of the following communication.

The first step we took was to analyse the raw bytes within the data field that are being sent over. 

\subsection{Raw byte analysis of the data fields}
From multiple traces whereby we opened a secure messaging session we found 9 bytes within the data sent from the card $\rightarrow$ API that remained constant. This made us think the data might be wrapped in an ASN.1 BER encoding. Using the online tool [?] we had utilised before (within chapter 6) we found 3 distinctive sets of data within the 265 bytes. 

\textbf{Send 265 bytes of data (cards public key) (A.3.1 - commands 24, 25)}\\
$[00]$ (1 byte) 05\\
$[01]$ (128 byte) F7 B5  15 72 07 22 94 6F C4 08 ...\\
$[02]$ (128 byte) 3C 52 D2 06 89 28 92 2C AB E6 ...\\

\textit{These command bytes in the BER encoding of the data have been highlighted in bold within the commands in the appendix to make it clear how the data is split.}

We did not find any of the other data fields wrapped in an ASN.1 BER encoding. Thus now we know the following:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Data & Explanation\\
\hline
Cards public key & (1 byte) = 05\\
(static key)    & (128 bytes) = F7 B5  15 72 07 22 94 6F C4 08 ...\\
                 & (128 bytes) = 3C 52 D2 06 89 28 92 2C AB E6 ...\\
\hline
API data & (128 bytes) = 08 9F EA  A1 DC 8F C3 43 ...\\
\textit{public key or encrypted data} & \\
(Not static) & \\
\hline
Card random challenge & (32 bytes) = 66 56 36 31 16 42 8D 8A ...\\
(Not static) & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Data organization within secure messaging initialization process}
\end{table}

Using the information within table 7.9 we now begin finding protocols that would allow session keys to be derived, and also match the amount of data being sent across from the API to the card and vice versa.

\subsection{Protocol search}
There are three main protocols that would support session keys being derived that would remain a secret between the API and the card. These are: RSA encryption, elliptic curve cofactor diffie hellman (ECCDH) and diffie hellman (DH) [see section 3]. 

Within security policies for 'Athena smartcard solutions' [?] it states that ECCDH is used for some of their smartcards. And that the 32 bytes of random data sent by the card is used to XOR with the shared secret derived from ECCDH to create the 2 session keys. 

\textit{[The same documentation stated that the shared secret dervied from ECCDH was 32 bytes in length, and the session keys were 2 x  \textbf{Triple DES (key option 2)} 16 byte keys]}

The card we analyse supports the key generation of elliptic curve public and private keys for this exact purpose, and for signing and verifying data. Thus the first protocol we look into is ECCDH.\\

\underline{\textbf{Elliptic Curve Cofactor Diffie Hellman}}\\
The smartcard we analyse only supports curves P-192, and P-521 for ECCDH [see section 3]. The security polices state that curve P-256 is used. This is our first indication that the smartcard we analyse is not using ECCDH. However we continue with the investigation in case one of the above curves is used.

The first step we take is to calculate the number of bytes that are required in order to setup the global parameters that must be sent from the card to the API for ECCDH, and also the number of bytes of each public key. A match between these calculations and the number of bytes that are in fact sent across could suggest this protocol is being utilised for secure messaging initialization. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Elliptic Curve Field & P-192 & P-256 & P521\\
\hline
Global Parameter Length & 233 & 233 & 233\\
Public Key Length & 48 & 64 & 131-132\\
\hline
Total & \textbf{281} & \textbf{297} & \textbf{364}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Number of bytes required for ECCDH [Card to API]}
\end{table}

As shown in table 7.10 non of the curves for ECCDH have a value of 257 bytes in total that would be sent from the card to the API to begin the protocol. Thus we conclude here that ECCDH is not used.
