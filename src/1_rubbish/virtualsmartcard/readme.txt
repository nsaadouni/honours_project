if I want to use this 'testing_MiTM' then I need to get the virtualsmartcard folder from VPCD installation

It was just a test to see how the virtual smartcard package works.
Now I understand how to use the package it is unessacary to use the entire thing as I only rely on the 'relay' card and the 'virtualICC'
